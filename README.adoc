A command line interface for crafting Git repository milestones (also known as _tags_).

toc::[]

== Features

* Uses link:https://www.alchemists.io/projects/versionaire[Versionaire] for
  link:https://semver.org[Semantic Versioning].
** Format: `+<major>.<minor>.<patch>+`.
** Example: `+0.1.0+`.
* Ensures Git commits since last tag (or initialization of repository) are included.
* Ensures Git commit messages are grouped by prefix, in order defined. For more details, see
  link:https://www.alchemists.io/projects/git-cop/#_commit_subject_prefix[Git Cop Subject Prefix]
  for details. Defaults (can be customized):
** Fixed
** Added
** Updated
** Removed
** Refactored
* Ensures Git commit messages are alphabetically sorted.
* Ensures duplicate Git commit messages are removed (if any).
* Provides optional security for signing Git tags with https://www.gnupg.org[GnuPG] signing key.

== Requirements

. A UNIX-based system.
. https://www.ruby-lang.org[Ruby].
. https://www.gnupg.org[GnuPG].

== Setup

To install, run:

[source,bash]
----
gem install milestoner
----

== Usage

=== Command Line Interface (CLI)

From the command line, type: `+milestoner help+`

....
milestoner -C, [--commits]          # Show commits for next milestone.
milestoner -P, [--publish=VERSION]  # Tag and push milestone to remote repository.
milestoner -c, [--config]           # Manage gem configuration.
milestoner -h, [--help=COMMAND]     # Show this message or get help for a command.
milestoner -p, [--push=VERSION]     # Push local tag to remote repository.
milestoner -t, [--tag=VERSION]      # Tag local repository with new version.
milestoner -v, [--version]          # Show gem version.
....

For config options, type: `+milestoner help --config+`

....
-e, [--edit], [--no-edit]  # Edit gem configuration.
-i, [--info], [--no-info]  # Print gem configuration info.
....

For tag options, type: `+milestoner help --tag+`

....
-s, [--sign], [--no-sign]  # Sign tag with GPG key.
....

For publish options, type: `+milestoner help --publish+`

....
-s, [--sign], [--no-sign]  # Sign tag with GPG key.
....

When using Milestoner, the `+--publish+` command is intended to be the only command necessary for
publishing a new release as it handles all of the steps necessary for tagging and pushing a new
milestone. Should individual steps be needed, then the `+--tag+` and `+--push+` options are
available.

=== Customization

This gem can be configured via a global configuration:

....
~/.config/milestoner/configuration.yml
....

It can also be configured via https://www.alchemists.io/projects/xdg[XDG] environment variables.

The default configuration is as follows:

[source,yaml]
----
:git_commit_prefixes:
  - Fixed
  - Added
  - Updated
  - Removed
  - Refactored
:git_tag_sign: false
----

Feel free to take this default configuration, modify, and save as your own custom
`+configuration.yml+`.

The `+configuration.yml+` file can be configured as follows:

* `+git_commit_prefixes+`: Should the default prefixes not be desired, you can define Git commit
prefixes that match your style. _NOTE: Prefix order is important with the first prefix defined
taking precedence over the second and so forth._ Special characters are allowed for prefixes but
should be enclosed in quotes. To disable prefix usage completely, use an empty array. Example:
`+:git_commit_prefixes: []+`.
* `+git_tag_sign+`: Defaults to `+false+` but can be enabled by setting to `+true+`. When enabled, a
Git tag will require GPG signing for enhanced security and include a signed signature as part of the
Git tag. This is useful for public milestones where the author of a milestone can be verified to
ensure milestone integrity/security.

== Security

To securely sign your Git tags, install and configure https://www.gnupg.org[GPG]:

[source,bash]
----
brew install gpg
gpg --gen-key
----

When creating your GPG key, choose these settings:

* Key kind: RSA and RSA (default)
* Key size: 4096
* Key validity: 0
* Real Name: `+<your name>+`
* Email: `+<your email>+`
* Passphrase: `+<your passphrase>+`

To obtain your key, run the following and take the part after the forward slash:

....
gpg --list-keys | grep pub
....

Add your key to your global Git configuration in the `+[user]+` section. Example:

....
[user]
  signingkey = <your GPG key>
....

Now, when publishing a new milestone (i.e.Â `+milestoner --publish <version> --sign+`), signing of
your Git tag will happen automatically. You will be prompted for the GPG Passphrase each time but
that is to be expected.

== Development

== Versioning

Read link:https://semver.org[Semantic Versioning] for details. Briefly, it means:

* Major (X.y.z) - Incremented for any backwards incompatible public API changes.
* Minor (x.Y.z) - Incremented for new, backwards compatible, public API enhancements/fixes.
* Patch (x.y.Z) - Incremented for small, backwards compatible, bug fixes.
