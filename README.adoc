Milestoner is a command line interface for crafting Git repository tags (milestones) using semantic
versions. Each milestone is a summary of all commits made since the last milestone. You can use
Milestoner to inspect what is currently unreleased or create a new release via a single command. By
having a tool, like Milestoner, you can quickly manage/automate releases in a consistent and
reliable fashion. Milestoner also pairs well with
link:https://www.alchemists.io/projects/git-lint[Git Lint] for further ensuring you have commit
messages of high quality for your release notes.

== Features

* Uses link:https://www.alchemists.io/projects/versionaire[Versionaire] for
  link:https://semver.org[Semantic Versioning].
** Format: `+<major>.<minor>.<patch>+`.
** Example: `+0.1.0+`.
* Ensures Git commits since last tag (or initialization of repository) are included.
* Ensures Git commit messages are grouped by prefix, in order defined. For more details, see
  link:https://www.alchemists.io/projects/git-lint/#_commit_subject_prefix[Git Lint Commit Subject
  Prefix] for details. Defaults (can be customized):
** Fixed
** Added
** Updated
** Removed
** Refactored
* Ensures Git commit messages are alphabetically sorted.
* Ensures duplicate Git commit messages are removed (if any).
* Provides optional security for signing Git tags with https://www.gnupg.org[GnuPG] signing key.

== Requirements

. A UNIX-based system.
. https://www.ruby-lang.org[Ruby].
. https://www.gnupg.org[GnuPG].

== Setup

To install, run:

[source,bash]
----
gem install milestoner
----

== Usage

=== Command Line Interface (CLI)

From the command line, type: `milestoner --help`

....
USAGE:
  -c, --config ACTION                      Manage gem configuration. Actions: edit || view.
  -h, --help                               Show this message.
  -P, --publish VERSION                    Tag and push milestone to remote repository.
  -s, --status                             Show project status.
  -v, --version                            Show gem version.

SECURITY OPTIONS:
      --[no-]sign                          Sign with GPG key. Default: true.
....

Examples:

[source,bash]
----
milestoner --config edit
milestoner --config view

milestoner --help

milestoner --publish 0.1.0
milestoner --publish 0.1.0 --sign
milestoner --publish 0.1.0 --no-sign

milestoner --status
milestoner --version
----

=== Customization

This gem can be configured via a global configuration:

....
~/.config/milestoner/configuration.yml
....

It can also be configured via https://www.alchemists.io/projects/xdg[XDG] environment variables.

The default configuration is as follows:

[source,yaml]
----
:documentation:
  :format: "md"
:git:
  :commit:
    :prefixes:
      - Fixed
      - Added
      - Updated
      - Removed
      - Refactored
  :tag:
    :sign: false
----

Feel free to take this default configuration, modify, and save as your own custom
`+configuration.yml+`.

The `+configuration.yml+` file can be configured as follows:

* *Documenation Format*: Determines what format the status information should be rendered. Defaults
  to link:https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown[Markdown] (i.e. `md`) but
  link:https://asciidoctor.org/docs/what-is-asciidoc[ASCII Doc] (i.e. `adoc`) is supported too.
* *Git Commit Prefixes*: Should the default prefixes not be desired, you can define Git commit
  prefixes that match your style. _NOTE: Prefix order is important with the first prefix defined
  taking precedence over the second and so forth._ Special characters are allowed for prefixes but
  should be enclosed in quotes. To disable prefix usage completely, use an empty array. Example:
  `:prefixes: []`.
* *Git Tag Sign*: Defaults to `false` but can be enabled by setting to `true`. When enabled, a
  Git tag will require GPG signing for enhanced security and include a signed signature as part of
  the Git tag. This is useful for public milestones where the author of a milestone can be verified
  to ensure milestone integrity/security.

== Security

To securely sign your Git tags, install and configure https://www.gnupg.org[GPG]:

[source,bash]
----
brew install gpg
gpg --gen-key
----

When creating your GPG key, choose these settings:

* Key kind: RSA and RSA (default)
* Key size: 4096
* Key validity: 0
* Real Name: `+<your name>+`
* Email: `+<your email>+`
* Passphrase: `+<your passphrase>+`

To obtain your key, run the following and take the part after the forward slash:

....
gpg --list-keys | grep pub
....

Add your key to your global Git configuration in the `+[user]+` section. Example:

....
[user]
  signingkey = <your GPG key>
....

Now, when publishing a new milestone (i.e.Â `+milestoner --publish <version> --sign+`), signing of
your Git tag will happen automatically. You will be prompted for the GPG Passphrase each time but
that is to be expected.
